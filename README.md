# sketchpad

Part of the Odin Project "Etch-a-Sketch"

The user can use the sketchpad to create pixel are:

- The grids are inserted through a for-loop which creates a given number of divs inside a container-div in the html.
- The user can choose a pen color from a color picker or click the rainbow button to use randomly generated RGB colors.
- The user can set the grid sizes (within the range 1x1 to 100x100).
- The coloring starts by pressing the mouse button on entering the first desired grid box to be painted. The user can hold the mouse button down to continue inking. The drawing stops when user releases the mouse button.
- The user can clear the grids by pressing the 'clear' button.
- The user may choose whether grid lines should be visible.
- The user user can set the preferred background color by choosing an option from the color picker.

Note an eraser was not added, since the user can match the pen's color picker to the chosen background color.

The first version of the Sketch Pad used hovering to color the grid boxes (the children of the container-div). If you would like to check-out the old version, check out the 'old version' folder.
