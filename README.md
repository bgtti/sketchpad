# sketchpad

Part of the Odin Project "Etch-a-Sketch"

The user can draw in a pixelated version on the sketchpad:

- The grids are inserted through a for-loop which creates a given number of divs inside a container-div in the html.
- The user can choose a pen color from a color picker or click the rainbow button to use randomly generated RGB colors.
- The user can set the grid sizes (within the range 1x1 to 100x100).
- The user can clear the grids by pressing the 'clear' button.
